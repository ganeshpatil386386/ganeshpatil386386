<p>  
I am <a href="https://beacons.ai/ganeshpatil">Ganesh Pail</a> from India and now you're here! on my github profile so it's time to introduce myself. 

I love to document my journey by writing code, articles✍🏻 and creating content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMse2JYXPbtlzcnkbXmVQQ). I always believe skills matters a lot, Writing code and Article are the two most important things that every developer should learn on priority. I started contributing to opensource from last two years and then I joined aviyel community as a contributor.💜 

I started contributing with creating roadmaps, projects guides and technical documentations most of non-techical stuff. I enjoyed [writing](https://dev.to/patilganesh1010) a lot and explaing terms to community because writing gives you more power to think creative. 📝

I write code👩🏻‍🏫 with Javascript, Python and sometime Golang. Building projects is the best way to learn programming and that's how coding helps me a lot to solve real time problems. 

I joined [Aviyel](https://aviyel.com/discussions) as a Community Manager where the creative minds work on simplifying opensource and collaborating with other communities for sustainable growth.🎯
I strive to be better by learning, reading, and building healthy relationships. As a developer and content creator its not easy to manage time but planning and scheduling with right approach helps a lot.
